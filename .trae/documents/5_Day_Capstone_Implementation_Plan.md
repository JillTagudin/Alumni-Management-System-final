# 5-Day Capstone Presentation Implementation Plan
## Alumni Management System - Stability-Focused Enhancement

### Overview
This plan prioritizes **STABILITY and RELIABILITY** over ambitious new features. The goal is to enhance existing functionality with robust error handling, comprehensive testing, and visual improvements that guarantee zero malfunctions during the presentation.

### Core Principles
- **Quality over Quantity**: Focus on perfecting existing features
- **Zero-Risk Enhancements**: Only implement changes that can be thoroughly tested
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Every feature must have fallback mechanisms
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multiple validation layers for all functionality
